    <li>Wikis should have at least 100 articles, of which at least 25 should not be considered stubs.</li>

            <li>Discussions</li>
            <li>Template documentation</li>
        </ol>
    <li>Wikis should have policies in place to ensure quality content, prevent vandalism, etc. and an active staff to enforce them.</li>
    <li>Wikis need to maintain independence in such a way that their community as a whole can decide its internal and external policies.</li>
        <ol>
            <li>This includes the ability to choose to shut itself down, change hosts, etc.</li>
        </ol>
    </ol>

    <p>Once you apply, the community will discuss and vote internally to decide on membership.</p>
